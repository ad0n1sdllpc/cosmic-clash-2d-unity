## About the Game
A 2D Unity arcade game inspired by Rayman Legends' Kung Foot and Head Soccer, featuring cute alien characters. The game can be played against AI or in a 1v1 PVP local couch multiplayer mode. The goal is simple: two players aim to score by getting the ball into the opponent's goal. The first player to reach the defined score limit wins.
